This project is an object oriented Java API that implements the client side of the owserver protocol. It can be used to build Java programs that use data from sensors attached to an 1-wire (onewire) network.

It is built upon OWNet.java (http://www.owfs.org) and exposes a high level API for reading data from sensors on a 1-wire network.

The library exposes sensors attached to a 1-wire network as collections of objects, and the library handles all 1-wire specific implementation details.
