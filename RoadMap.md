## Upcomming Features ##

  * Caching of 1-wire device tree structure to speed up repeated find() and read().
  * More consistent and stringent CLI.

## Planned Features - Short Term ##
  * Integrate current 1-wire object model with external meta data service. Consuming applications need metadata about 1-wire devices, and the library should have optional support for this metadata service.

## Long Term Road Map ##

  * More elaborate simulation data for testing 1-wire bus operations.
